# Customization

Municipio is built to be flexible in as many ways as possible. Therefore it provides a set of useful customization tools. 


## Customizer

The customizer is extended in Municipio to easily provide css variable manipulation, add view varaibles and implement modifiers regulated by context in a no-code environment. All you need is a local install, with acf pro enabled to get going. The functionality requires ACF Customizer plugin, which is bundled in the application packages. 

There are three major concepts in the customizer, they are the following:

- View Variables
- Filter (Modifier)
- Css Variable
