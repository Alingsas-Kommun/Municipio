# Municipio 1.0 (for Helsingborg stad)

## Getting started
To get started you'll need to install node and bower components. To install these components you will need to have Node.js installed on your system.

```
$Â cd [THEME-DIR]
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

## Coding standards
For PHP, use PSR-2 and PSR-4 where applicable.

## Dependencies and components
We manage our dependencies and components with npm and bower. Please check the `package.json` file to see Node dependencies and check the `bower.json`to see the Bower components.

## Gulp
We use Gulp to compile, concatenate and minify SASS and JavaScript.
The compiling of SASS will also automatically add vendor-prefixes where needed.

To compile both js and sass and start the "watch" mode in one command, run the following command from the theme directory:
```
$ gulp
```

#### Available Gulp tasks

All these commands should be run from the theme directory with:

```
$ gulp [TASK]
